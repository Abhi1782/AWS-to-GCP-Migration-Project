# AWS-to-GCP-Migration-Project
This project demonstrates the migration of a running server workload from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google’s VM Migration service. The source server hosted a web application using Apache2, and the migration ensured minimal downtime with full replication and cutover.
